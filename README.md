# Markdown Converter

* An incomplete, probably very innefficient, and simple markdown converter that suits my purposes.
* This provides for the following use cases
* * You need a small Javascript file that you can include in an HTML file by referenceing it in a script tag
  * You want a function that can be copied or pasted into a file
